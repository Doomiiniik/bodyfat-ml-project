# 🏋️ Body Fat Estimator (Metric Version)

I built this project to turn the classic 1996 BodyFat dataset into a practical tool. The original data was messy and used Imperial units (lbs/inches), so I focused heavily on cleaning and standardizing the data for modern metric users.

##  Why I built this
Most body fat calculators online are black boxes. I wanted to build a transparent model that shows exactly which measurements (like Abdomen and Weight) impact the result most.

##  What’s inside
* **Cleaned Data:** I wrote a preprocessing script that:
    * Converts Weight to **kg** and Measurements to **cm**.
    * Drops impossible data (like the record with 29 inches of height or 0% body fat).
    * Removes the 'Density' column to prevent "cheating" (data leakage).
* **Interactive CLI:** You can run `main.py` and type in your own stats (weight and abdomen) to get a prediction immediately.

##  How to use it
1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/Doomiiniik/bodyfat-ml-project
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the tool: `python main.py` (from the main project directory!).

##  Model Performance
After testing a few different approaches, I settled on a Linear Regression model. 
* **Reasoning:** It's lightweight, easy to understand, and in my tests, it slightly outperformed **Lasso** and **Ridge** models in terms of accuracy.
* **Key Features:** It turns out **Abdomen** size  and **Weight** are the biggest predictors, adding more variables actually increased the MSE (Mean Squared Error)

##  Project Structure

* **`main.py`**: The main entry point. It features an interactive CLI that guides the user through entering their measurements (Metric) and returns an instant prediction.

* **`src/`** (Source Code)
    * `preprocessing.py`: The "Data Factory" containing logic for unit conversion (lbs/inches to kg/cm) and filtering out biological outliers (e.g., height errors).
    * `predictor.py`: The inference engine that manages model loading and feature scaling to ensure production-level reliability.

* **`notebooks/`** (The Laboratory)
    * Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This is where I performed feature correlation studies and compared models (Linear Regression vs. Lasso).

* **`models/`** (The Saved Brains)
    * `model.pkl`: The trained Linear Regression coefficients.
    * `scaler.pkl`: The StandardScaler used to normalize input data (e.g., making sure 80kg and 180cm are on the same scale for the math).
    * `features.pkl`: A serialized list of the exact feature names and their order. This ensures the model always receives the data in the correct sequence (e.g., Weight then Abdomen, not the other way around).

* **`data/`**
    * `bodyfat.csv`: The raw 1996 dataset.
    * `bodyfat_processed.csv`: The cleaned, metric-ready version generated by the preprocessing script.

* **`requirements.txt`**: A comprehensive list of dependencies (Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.) needed to replicate the environment.
